# You could save space in the docker image by putting all the R package installs on the same line - so you only get one layer
# However if you change any line in the docker file, when you rebuild the docker image it has to do the whole of that line again - which can be time consuming - and potentially break your system as the latest version of packages will be downloaded
# Therefore in this instance I prefer to just add a new line at the bottom
