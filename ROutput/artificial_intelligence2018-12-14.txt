Then look no further! Edissero has an excellent opportunity for a graduate/junior to join our small, friendly and professional resourcing team based in the heart of Godalming. We've been recruiting technical authors since 2003 and we work with some of the most innovative and interesting gaming, software, artificial intelligence, fintech and engineering companies all over the UK, Europe and sometimes further afield, too.

Writing incisive and informative supporting notes for each submitted CV. Keeping our database meticulously up-to-date. Being obsessively organised; we gain huge satisfaction from writing and then gleefully ticking off a daily-to do list (we should probably get out more). Visiting clients and nosing around their often very exciting offices. Sometimes you'll even go out for coffee and cake, which leads neatly on to: Either talking about or actually eating delicious food. Being genuinely (or at least pretending to be) interested in looking at our respective pet dog/cat pictures.
