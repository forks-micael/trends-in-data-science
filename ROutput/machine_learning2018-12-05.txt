Millennials should read the news more!  Does this sound familiar? It is an all too common argument that not enough young people read and engage with the news but did anybody ever think that maybe this isn't the fault of these young people? The world has moved on, nobody has the time to sit down and read a broadsheet cover to cover anymore! Neither do we have the time to sift through all the crap articles, fake news and clickbait just to get an understanding of the most important issues. Maybe, just maybe, it is journalism which is broken? Red Cat Digital's newest client certainly think so. The Company My client is a VC-funded journalism start-up with an aim of building something that connects people to the news in a meaningful way. They are passionate about helping people understand what is happening in the world, what it means and why it matters. Their product is a mobile app that summarises the biggest news stories in bullet points twice a day. Unlike many news feeds that scroll endlessly, theirs is designed to be consumed in its entirety. To do this they have developed an Artificial Intelligence editor which is able to process millions of articles and pick out the very best, with a summarisation system able to produce effective extractive summaries. With a current team of 10 people, they now have a clear roadmap which includes expanding to 25 people in the next 6-12 months. The NLP Engineer Role The next stage of this growth includes finding somebody to lead their NLP efforts. This engineer will have a passion to NLP and will focus on building and improving their AI systems further. As well as the summarisation system they have also developed a category classifier which is able to identify the topic of an article from its content, as well as an evergreen classifier which is able to identify news articles which are likely to stay relevant over time. Key tasks and responsibilities include: Acquisition, cleansing, processing and visualising the integrity of data used for analysis Data mining using state-of-the-art techniques Building and optimising classifiers using machine learning & NLP techniques Deploying machine learning systems into production Delivering real impact to the product through rigorous data-driven solutions Collaborating with product managers, engineers and developers to improve data infrastructure The right person for this role will have a passion for Natural Language Processing with demonstrable experience developing similar classifiers. You will be experienced in leading a team of engineers but will also still be very much hands-on'. You will have strong expertise with Python as well as with relevant libraries and toolkits such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn etc. as well as with databases such as SQL and NoSQL. It is expected you will have an educational background in a mathematical discipline and will be experienced in statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. If you have any experience working in a start-up this is also a plus! Although it is not a necessity. In return you will join an exciting niche start-up with a bright future and have the chance to develop and grow your own team, expected to be 3-4 people within the next year.
