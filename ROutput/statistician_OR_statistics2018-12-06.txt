"Head of Animals in Science Regulation Unit"	"GBP"	"London"	"Permanent"	"Head of Animals in Science Regulation Unit"	"London - GBP"	"Permanent"	"Posted: Tuesday, 4 December 2018"	""	"The Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) is a part of the Home Office Security, Science & Innovation Directorate within Capabilities and Resources. We regulate the use of animals in scientific research for the benefit of people, animals and the environment, through the provision of impartial licensing procedures and evidence-based advice, and by encouraging the development and use of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) nationally. Scientific research using animals plays a vital part in our understanding of how biological systems work both in health and disease. It supports the development of new medicines and cutting edge medical technologies, both for humans and animals. It also underpins the safe marketing and use of chemicals, development of improved veterinary and agricultural practices, as well as underpinning policy decisions on the safety and sustainability of our environment. By law, the use of animals in all these ways must be licenced. This research contributes to the UK's world-class research base in medical, environmental, agricultural and other life sciences, which has significant economic value to the UK. The Home Office regulates the use of animals in scientific procedures in England, Scotland and Wales. This is carried out by the Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA). The regulatory system in the UK has been the model for several overseas legislative frameworks and the unit is frequently asked to contribute expertise on an international stage. The legislation provides a rigorous regulatory system, which ensures that animal research and testing is carried out only where no practicable alternative exists (Replacement), where numbers are minimised (Reduction) and under controls which keep suffering to a minimum (Refinement). This regulatory system enjoys strong support from licensees, who see it as a vital component for maintaining public support for their work. However, it remains a controversial topic with some sectors and this generates much correspondence and challenge. It is UK policy that no animal testing is permitted for cosmetics, tobacco products or alcohol. However, these policies need to be reviewed to consider previously unseen developments which may suggest legitimate exemptions from these longstanding policies. It is not permitted to use great apes (eg chimpanzees) or strays of domestic species (eg cats and dogs). Dogs, cats, non-human primates and horses receive special protection and require higher levels of oversight for their use in research. Such research generates much public interest. ASRU sits within the Home Office for reasons of independence (it is the only relevant department of state that does not also fund or sponsor research into animals) and of security (animal rights activism is still part of the National Risk Assessment). The Role The Head of Unit is responsible for the leadership of the Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) and effective delivery of the operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA). Key responsibilities Specifically, the role holder will be responsible for: 1.
