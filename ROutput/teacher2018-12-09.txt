Are you ready to take on the challenge of running a small team? Do you enjoy debate and (friendly) argument as a way to test your knowledge and assumptions? You write code, and you thrive on the challenge of making that code artistic in its simplicity. C# is your language of choice, but you take pride in being able to answer \"probably, yeah\" when someone asks \"I've got this bit of code that doesn't work, can you fix it?\" without having to ask what it's written in. You like neat, orderly separations between layers of code, enjoy the speed boots fluent mappings and ORMs provide but are worldly enough to know they've got their downsides too, and you like the idea of cloud and micro-services but have been around the block enough to know where the traps are. You revel in the freedom to suggest and implement new technologies - but you don't have problems supporting existing code and get your hands dirty with the odd bit of Legacy product. You like the idea of leading a team of developers, but prefer to spend your day in Visual Studio than in Outlook and Excel, and as much as you relish the opportunity to share your knowledge you don't want to be a teacher. You'll lead a small team of developers and QA engineers as a sub-team working on our SaaS product. You'll take part in sprints alongside other teams - spread across the UK, Ireland and Adelaide - and represent your team's work in scrums and scrum-of-scrums with the other TAs. What does the ideal candidate look like? - Excellent Technical skills, with the \"depth\" bit in C#, MVC and enterprise applications and breadth in just about anything tech - Excellent JavaScript skills, including exposure to Bootstrap, knockout, knockback, angular, node or similar and a good understanding of the underlying processes involved in ajax - Excellent SQL skills, including familiarity with query execution plans, optimisations and index maintenance, memory pinned tables and analysis services, reporting services and big-data techniques - A firm belief that code that doesn't have unit tests and automated test suites isn't worth having - Experience on Azure, AWS or similar, including IaaS and PaaS What's in it for you? As well as a competitive salary, pension contributions and holiday allowances, you'll have the opportunity to directly influence both the technology and product roadmap of a growing, ambitious company with some amazing people in it. You'll work alongside experts in a number of fields, and they'll put you through training on the technical tools and platforms (including for Microsoft certifications) as well as in management and organisational effectiveness You'll engage directly with experts from Microsoft and the wider tech sphere, as well as with our customers, and you'll build your own profile and reputation rather than being an anonymous cubicle farm drone.

We help parents and children to love learning maths together. Having evidenced that our project improves outcomes across 50 schools we are now growing with the aim of supporting tens of thousands of parents through hundreds of schools across the UK. We are recruiting a New Partnerships Manager to join our rapidly evolving social enterprise. As New Partnerships Manager you will bring new partner schools on board and support our current partners to make the most of our support. You will work to continue our rapid growth, allowing us to maximise our impact with more children, parents and schools. You will be joining our social enterprise at an early stage, so will work closely with the CEO and the Programme Director to develop our online platform to drive real social change. About Maths with Parents  Half of children from the poorest backgrounds do not reach the expected standard in maths at the end of primary school. Half. These children go on to underachieve at GCSE and are more likely to be unemployed as adults. Primary schools have made great steps forward in maths teaching in recent years, so why are the poorest children still underachieving? The answer lies outside the school gates: in low-income households parental engagement occurs less frequently, is less targeted and overall is less effective than in higher income households (Kalil, 2014). Children often tell us how much they enjoy maths at school, but many of these same kids go home and are told \"I've always been rubbish at maths, so you will be too\" by their parents. Maths homework is a miserable chore in too many households, supported by parents who were never taught the new methods that their child learns. Maths with Parents works with primary schools to create a tailored package of support for the parents and children in every class. Every fortnight parents receive updates about what their child is currently learning, a short video in which kids explain how the maths is taught and fun activities to play together about this topic. Most importantly, these activities are fun! You won't find any worksheets or exam questions, just games, stories, dances, puzzles, adventures and more! It is our belief that Maths with Parents can normalize playing fun maths games at home. Parents read with their child, so why is there no maths equivalent? Our programme is changing attitudes to maths and has the potential to reach every household in the country. With our support we are convinced that every child can enjoy and succeed in maths. About the role As New Partnerships Manager you will work closely with the CEO and the Programme Director to drive the growth of Maths with Parents. As the organisation grows, we expect the role to evolve and there will be opportunities for progression. Initially your responsibilities will include: Securing sales meetings with schools and providing in-person demonstrations of the Maths with Parents platform Attending conferences and networking events to generate leads Meeting sales targets and a high resubscription rate Maintaining outstanding relationships with existing partner schools, which includes delivering in-person or remote support to ensure they make the most of the platform. Ensure that our CRM is kept up to date. Feedback from school conversations and provide input on proposed development plans and timelines. Travel - most days you will be out visiting prospective schools or working with partner schools you have previously organised to meet Depending on the needs of the organisation, your role is likely to evolve over time. This role requires someone who is motivated to work in a small team to develop the organisation and drive it forward. We are looking for someone who is willing to be a doer as well as a thinker; to strategise as well as to undertake the nuts and bolts as required. You will have to be as comfortable working with an individual teacher as speaking in front of a room of headteachers. The rewards of joining the organisation at this time are huge. Not only will you experience the fulfilment of enabling a small organisation to grow, but you will have a key role in deciding how the organisation grows.
