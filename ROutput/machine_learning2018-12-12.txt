We're here to change that. We're working hard to develop exciting new technologies, harnessing the power of machine learning and combining this with extensive domain expertise to enable testing to be performed fully autonomously. Something akin to self-driving cars of the testing world! We know this is no easy feat, but nothing worth doing ever is. If you're excited and inspired by the prospect of working with a team of highly educated, expert engineers from around the world to build ground-breaking, and dare we say game-changing, applications to make testing easier, more efficient and autonomous, then we'd like to talk with you. You'll have the freedom to make decisions quickly and execute them, to work collaboratively with colleagues in other countries, (advanced written and spoken English is a must), and you'll be able to apply your experience and education (degree or equivalent) to help us develop a robust and scalable enterprise product to allow organisations to test their software faster and more effectively than ever possible before. Here's a glimpse of some of the projects you'll work on and lead as a Machine Learning Engineer Building intelligent anomaly detection techniques Automatic summarisation of large-scale test results Automatic model inference Improve our existing models and classifiers and help us research/develop new ones Build ML algorithms and integrate, or support integration with our product Essential skills you'll need: Strong practical and theoretical experience with machine learning. Some understanding of Java in order to integrate ML algorithms into our codebase Strong abilities to wrangle and clean data High proficiency with the Linux command line Additional experience that is welcome: Strong programming skills in at least one major programming language (eg, Python, Java, C++) Conducted self-directed academic research and be comfortable setting a research agenda. Be a champion of quality - software design patterns and passion for writing clean code Have worked as part of a team to deliver high-quality software to a production environment Be comfortable reporting results to stakeholders and informing strategic decision-making Bonus Points for: A postgraduate degree (preferably PhD) in a relevant machine learning topic. Polyglot: can program effectively in a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. Experience with distributed systems (concurrency, consistency, partition tolerance) We know that as a Machine Learning Engineer you'll have a mix of different skills, technologies and experiences, so we've tried to keep our 'wants' to a minimum, and thought sharing details of our tech stack would be more interesting to you. Our Tech Stack: Java services (distributed architecture) Languages: Java, Javascript/Typescript/Node.js, Python PostgreSQL for relational database Vue/VueX for Front End Consul for discovery AWS (ECS, S3, CloudFront, ALB) Prometheus for metric monitoring ELK for logging Terraform for infrastructure management Github for source control CircleCI for CI/CD Hazelcast Your favourite technology that can help solve challenges BENEFITS What else is in it for you? The opportunity to bring your own ideas to reality (we love new solutions and ideas!) Team retreats every 6 months... somewhere nice because you've earned it!

Sabbatical opportunities Flexible and remote work options A new laptop and/or use your own equipment  We have a simple two-step technical assessment process as part of the overall interview: We don't expect you to write code in an unrealistic interview setting. To take away the stress of whiteboard tests, you get a small take-home challenge and you have a week to complete it (in a Gitlab repository that you can freely develop your code on) that will take no more than a few hours. If we're happy with your submission in step 1, we schedule a one-to-one Skype session to first provide you with detailed feedback on your submission, ask you a few more questions related to the code and solution you submitted and then it's over to you to interview us.

"Clinical Programming and Statistical Data Sciences Future Leader Prog."	"GBP"	"United Kingdom"	"Permanent"	"Clinical Programming and Statistical Data Sciences Future Leader Prog."	"United Kingdom - GBP"	"Permanent"	"Posted: Friday, 7 December 2018"	""	"Clinical Programmers at GSK sit within the Biostatistics function and represent industry leading SAS experts for the exquisite delivery (analysis and reporting) of our clinical studies and data submissions to global regulatory agencies. The discipline works globally, spread across regions (UK, US and India) and provides leadership and accountability for all programming aspects for medicines within all clinical phases of drug development. A programming graduate would get hands on experience in the analysis and reporting of clinical trials (first rotation) and play an important role in defining and implementing strategies to modernise data delivery for clinical development (second or third rotation). Statistical Data Sciences (SDS) is the start-up group for data science also within the Biostatistics function, alongside Clinical Programming and Clinical Statistics. Since one very common definition of \"data science\" is \"the intersection between programming, data wrangling and statistics\", a programming graduate should find time spent here useful, both for him/herself, and also in terms of helping the Biostatistics function develop its vision for data sciences within the wider Development organisation (second or third rotation).Is the Future Leader Programme for you?Not only do we want to find the right candidate, we want you to choose a scheme that's right for you. Our Future Leaders Programmes are for those who aspire to be leaders, inspire others and relish some of the world's biggest healthcare challenges. We believe in focusing on the patient and conducting our business with integrity, transparency and respect for everyone we work with. We invest heavily in your personal development to prepare you for a career as a leader through regular discussions with your line manager and support from a wide network of colleagues, but you are still the driver of your development. You will also have continuous training where 70% is on-the-job, 20% is through developmental relationships and 10% is through formal training and educational courses. Our programmes are two or three years long and usually have 3-4 rotations. This is to enhance the development of your skills through having a breadth and depth of our business areas. What to expect on the Clinical Programming and Statistical Data Sciences Future Leaders Programme:What you will do will be dictated by the needs of GSK's pipeline of products, the needs of the Biostatistics function and your role. Opportunities exist to work on the delivery of pipeline assets in specific or varied diseases and experience challenges faced when working in different phases of drug development (phases I to IV). You will also have the opportunity to contribute to introducing new innovations to drive efficiencies and to the \"upskill\" of Programmers and staff across the Biostatistics function with regard to common data science methods and philosophy. You'll spend 12 months in the role for which you have been hired (Clinical Programming), then spend sequential 12-month rotations supporting Standards and Efficiencies and Statistical Data Sciences, choosing your second and third rotations in the previous rotation. They will be in the country where you are employed and will meet both your developing aspirations and the needs of the department.  Our work is varied and challenging with the common goal to advance the science of human health.A day in the life of a Clinical Programmer FLP:You will collaborate with top clinical scientists and operational experts in the delivery of clinical trial results to progress medicines through drug development. You will gain insights into defining programming strategies for clinical trial reporting and regulatory submissions (planning and execution) You will receive training in SAS and other programming languages and then asked to apply your newly acquired skills for hands on analysis and reporting of clinical trial data, in adherence to study protocols and statistical analysis plans. You may also explore data analytics and visualisations to improve presentation and interpretation of results. You'd become familiar with industry-wide best practice and help to define and support the use of standards across the Clinical Programming function  You'd be encouraged to consider opportunities for the introduction of innovative approaches to improve standard processes. For example, increasing the use of automation for routine tasks and the application of machine learning to drive efficiencies and enable better focus resources. You'd help drive capability development across Clinical Programming to expand the breadth of programming skills beyond SAS into languages such as R and Python.  How would you develop as a Statistical Data Science FLPIt should be almost impossible for a programmer within SDS not to be exposed to cutting edge methods in coding/data science, to develop basic statistical skills through exposure to Statisticians in the team, and to learn about the R&D process and how data science methods can be brought to bear on its challenges. You'd be involved in the \"upskill\" of Biostatistics with regard to common data science methods and philosophy and apply these skills on specific projects related to clinical development workAt the moment, the group is developing a version-controlled code repository, to maximise the value that most of Biostatistics' population develop nearly every day. SDS is also developing a tool to identify clinical studies that measured biomarkers specific to scientific programmes in GSK, to pull those data into an analytics-ready form, and to make that platform available for clinical and research scientists. Other work involves developing prediction models for disease prognosis. Career prospect for Clinical Programming and Data Sciences Future LeadersAfter completing this three-year programme, you will return to the role for which you were hired. The breadth of relevant technical experience, business and interpersonal skills that you will have acquired, together with the mentoring and networking opportunities you will have experienced, will allow you to excel in your career at GSK.There is a thriving community of Programmers and Data Scientists working across multiple groups at GSK continually evolving to enhance the skills, processes and technologies that drive innovation and efficiency. Opportunities will be broad and plentiful.The successful candidate will haveA Bachelors or higher in mathematics, statistics or computer science or related discipline.In addition, ideally you will have: An innovative and flexible mindset The ability to deal with complexity comfortably Strong problem-solving ability Effective written and verbal communication skills A resilient and 'can do' attitude with scientific reasoning An interest in the analysis of scientific data, a keen eye for detail and high quality Experience with at least one programming language (preferably SAS) A little about GSK:We are a science-led global healthcare company that researches and develops innovative Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare products.
